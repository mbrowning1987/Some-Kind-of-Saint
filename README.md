This is a website, for my husbands band. Some Kind of Saint. Its just a rough start, and i am still working on it. I havent really styled it yet. 
I just wanted to get all the info on the page, and then style. Pictures are blurry, bc they dont have professional pictures done. That is to come
One of the links doesnt work right now, but i work on it daily for a few hours.
